Crafting a Basic Python To-Do List App: Stepwise Instructions
Step 1: Project Setup Before beginning to code, it is crucial to establish your project environment. Launch your preferred code editor, whether it's Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, a basic text editor, or Google Colab, and initiate a new Python file. Choose a suitable name for the file, like 'todo_app.py'.

Step 2 involves presenting a menu to the user. This menu will offer choices such as adding tasks, viewing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and exiting the program.

Step 3 involves incorporating the functionality to include tasks in our to-do list. We will request the user for a description of the task and subsequently add it to the existing list of tasks.

Step 4 involves developing a function for observing the tasks listed in the to-do list. This function will systematically go through the list, presenting each task along with its corresponding index.

Step 5 involves enabling users to indicate completion of tasks and subsequently eliminating them from the list.

Step 6 involves integrating all components into the main program logic. This entails crafting a loop that showcases the menu, captures user input, and triggers the relevant functions in accordance with the user's selection. Step 7 involves enhancing the durability of our to-do list by incorporating functionality to save and retrieve tasks from a file.
